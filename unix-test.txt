17.  List the first 4 lines of rate1, and create a new file called "rate3" (hint:use redirection)

18.  Create a new file called rate4 using the first 3 lines of rate1, and last two lines of rate2, using >> operator for appending

19.  Sort the words in sleep1 

20.  Find the lines in sleep1 that contains the letter "h", and print the words in sorted order (hint: use pipes)
